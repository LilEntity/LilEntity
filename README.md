# Greetings, mortals

<p> 🎨 I’m currently working on my bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering </p>
<p> 📚 I’m currently learning Java, C++, and C# as well as some game developing basics </p>
<p> 🧭 I’m looking to know more about software engineering and game development </p>
<p> 🌌 I’m looking for help with my ubiquitous procrastination </p>
<p> 💬 Ask me about nothing since I'm hella dumb </p>
<p> 🐾 Scugcat never dies </p>
